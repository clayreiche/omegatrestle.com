<div class="about1">ABOUT US</div>
<div class="about22"><p>Mater artium necessitas (lat.)</p>
<p>Necessity is the mother of invention (eng.)</p>
</div>
<div class="omegatxt"><p>Our goal is to recognize specific heavy construction industry needs, conceive and design potential structural remedies, and then further develop the most efficient solutions for implementation.</p>
<p>Omega Trestle, LLC is an independently funded, research and development company that evolved from years of assessing industry operational needs and implementing project specific engineered solutions. It was founded by Kevin Lathan and V. Larry Tsimmerman, who are  seasoned heavy construction veterans with complementary solutions geared skill sets.</p>
</div>
<br />
<div class="about2">Founders</div>
<div class="about3">Kevin Lathan, PE</div>
<div class="omegatxt"><p>Kevin Lathan is an accomplished heavy construction operations professional with over 30 years of experience in near shore marine and heavy civil construction.</p>
<p>He is a “heavy civil builder” with a global perspective, and a focus on fundamentals and continual improvement.  Mr. Lathan holds degrees in both Applied Physics and Civil Engineering, but it is his practical experience gained from years on the construction site that is his greatest asset.  These raw operational skills have been refined by mentorships at the highest levels in the global engineering community.</p>
<p>Mr. Lathan has been a contributing member of a number of project teams in the US and fifteen other countries , including landmark design-build projects in USA, Canada and the Caribbean.</p>
<p>Kevin Lathan's  role at Omega Trestle, LLC is industry needs assessment, and practical applications for new  design elements and protocols.</p>

<div class="about4">Formal Education</div>
<div class="omegatxt"><p><span class="bold">The State University of New York,</span>  Geneseo, New York</p>
<p>Bachelor of Arts in Applied Physics</p>
<p><span class="bold">The Ohio State University,</span>   Columbus, Ohio</p>
<p>Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering </p>
</div>
<div class="about3">V. Larry Tsimmerman, PE</div>
<div class="omegatxt"><p>Larry Tsimmerman is a highly sought after design expert in the engineering of heavy marine, temporary access and shoring structures.  Whether it be evaluating the optimum method of demolishing a bridge to assessing the repairs and causal natures of maritime collision, Mr. Tsimmerman's approach to problem solving is unique. It is founded on a solid fundamental engineering education and military training, coupled with over 30 years of experience working for European and US marine heavy civil construction companies.</p>
<p>As a result of this experience, Mr. Tsimmerman has developed an ability to solve very complex construction challenges with elegant and often simple solutions. This type of clarity of engineering vision is the result of a deep understanding of mathematics and the underlying laws of nature on which the engineering knowledge and formulae are based.</p>
<p>Larry Tsimmerman's role at Omega Trestle, LLC is the Chief Scientist and Engineer.</p>
